  <p>Software engineer focused on CI/CD and cloud-native systems.</p>
  <p>
    I work on delivery pipelines and metrics infrastructure to improve
    engineering productivity and observability. I'm particularly interested in
    designing secure execution environments where autonomous systems—such as CI
    jobs and AI agents—can operate with meaningful capabilities under strict
    constraints.

  <p>Outside of engineering, I enjoy landscape photography and music.</p>
